	<h2>2.Caramel Cold Coffee Recipe</h2>
	<p>INGREDIENTS
		<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups strong hot brewed coffee</li>
<li>1/4 cup caramel sauce, plus a little extra for garnish</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons sugar, to taste</li>
<li>coffee ice cubes or regular will work too</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups cold milk or half-and-half</li>

</ul>

After the coffee is finished brewing and is hot and fresh, pour 1 1/2 cups into a measuring cup. Stir in the caramel sauce. If you add the caramel sauce straight into the measuring cup, and you are using a 2 cup measuring cup, pour in the Caramel Syrup until it reached 1 3/4 cup with the coffee. Stir well.
Add your sugar and stir again until all sugar and caramel sauce is dissolved completely.
Place in the refrigerator and chill until cold.
When it's time to serve, divide your coffee mixture between two chilled glasses filled with ice (hint: coffee ice cubes are excellent here)
Add your milk or half-and-half to top the glass.
If you want the fancy coffee shop look, garnish with whipped cream and ground cinnamon if desired. Enjoy!
